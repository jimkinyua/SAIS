### System Requirements

- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2019/2022
- 2GB free disk space

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Extract the Project

1. Download the SAIS project zip file
2. Extract the contents to your desired location
3. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code

### 2. Configure Database Connection

The project includes two configuration files:

- `appsettings.Development.json` - Development settings
- `appsettings.Production.json` - Production settings

**For Development (Default):**
Update the connection string in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "SAISConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=SAIS_DB;Trusted_Connection=true;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  }
}
```

**For Production:**
Update the connection string in `appsettings.Production.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "SAISConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=SAIS_DB;User Id=YOUR_USERNAME;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  }
}
```

**Database Credentials:**

- **Development**: Uses Windows Authentication (Trusted_Connection=true)
- **Production**: Requires SQL Server username and password
- **Database Name**: SAIS_DB (can be changed as needed)

### 3. Build and Run

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

**Note**: Database migrations will run automatically on first startup, creating the database and tables with seed data. The application automatically detects the environment and loads the appropriate configuration file.

### 4. Access the Application

Navigate to Url generated in your browser.

**Note**: The application will automatically use the appropriate configuration file based on the environment (Development/Production).
